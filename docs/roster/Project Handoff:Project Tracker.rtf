\f0\fs24 \cf0 # NCAA D1 WBB Roster Analytics \'96 Project Handoff & Task Tracker\
\
This document is designed for continued work with an AI assistant (e.g., Claude/Claude Cowork) to manage tasks, run analyses, and build dashboards and presentations.\
\
---\
\
## 1. Project Summary\
\
**Goal:**  \
Analyze roster construction for NCAA D1 women\'92s basketball, starting with an exploratory analysis of AP Top 25 teams in 2025\'9626. Focus on age/experience, portal usage, positional balance, size, and bench depth, and how these relate to team performance (off/def efficiency, pace, margin). No predictive modeling in this phase.[web:10][web:25][web:26][web:32][web:33]\
\
**Key deliverables:**\
\
1. `player_season_analytic_2026` table.  \
2. `team_season_analytic_2026` table.  \
3. Tableau workbook(s) for Top 25 EDA.  \
4. Slide deck or narrative summary of findings.\

\
## 4. Workstreams & Task Lists\
\
### 4.1 Data Ingestion & Mapping\
\
**Objective:** Align roster, box scores, and team metadata under a consistent `team_id`.\
\
**Tasks:**\
\
1. **Add 2025\'9626 roster CSV to repo**\
   - [ ] Download `wbb_rosters_2025_26.csv` from Sports\uc0\u8209 Roster\u8209 Data.\
   - [ ] Save to `data/raw/2026/wbb_rosters_2025_26.csv`.\
   - [ ] Inspect columns and note team identifier fields and player identity fields.\
\
2. **Standardize team identifiers**\
   - [ ] Confirm how `team_id` in `team_box_2026.parquet` maps to `ncaa_id`/`team` in `teams_sports_roster_data.csv`.[file:44]\
   - [ ] If needed, create `team_id` \uc0\u8596  `ncaa_id` mapping table and store under `data/processed/team_id_mapping_2026.csv`.\
   - [ ] Verify mapping for a subset of teams (e.g., South Carolina, Iowa, LSU, UConn).\
\
3. **Link roster teams to `team_id`**\
   - [ ] Use `ncaa_id` or cleaned team names to join `wbb_rosters_2025_26.csv` to `teams_sports_roster_data.csv`.\
   - [ ] Add a `team_id` column (matching box score tables) to the roster data.\
\
### 4.2 Player\uc0\u8209 Season Table Construction\
\
**Objective:** Build `player_season_analytic_2026` from box and roster data.\
\
**Tasks:**\
\
1. **Aggregate player box to player\uc0\u8209 season**\
   - [ ] Group `player_box_2026.parquet` by `season`, `team_id`, `athlete_id`, `athlete_display_name`.\
   - [ ] Compute total minutes, games played, and sum of counting stats.\
   - [ ] Compute `minutes_per_game`.\
\
2. **Join roster attributes**\
   - [ ] Join aggregated player table to roster table using `team_id` + name (or a future ID link).\
   - [ ] Bring in `class`, `height`, `position`, hometown, previous school.\
\
3. **Derive flags and archetypes**\
   - [ ] Derive `class_group` and `exp_level` (FR=1, SO=2, JR=3, SR+=4).\
   - [ ] Derive `archetype` (Guard/Wing/Big) from position fields.\
   - [ ] Derive `transfer_flag` using previous school/historical info.\
   - [ ] Derive `intl_flag` using country/state fields.\
\
4. **Export**\
   - [ ] Save `data/processed/player_season_analytic_2026.parquet` and/or `.csv`.\
\
### 4.3 Team Performance Table\
\
**Objective:** Build a season\uc0\u8209 level team performance table compatible with roster metrics.\
\
**Tasks:**\
\
1. **Leverage existing scout\uc0\u8209 report pipeline (preferred)**\
   - [ ] Confirm `game_analysis.parquet` includes ortg, drtg, net_rtg, pace for each team\'96game.[file:43]\
   - [ ] Group by `season`, `team_id` to compute season means:\
     - `games_played`, `offensive_eff`, `defensive_eff`, `margin`, `tempo`.\
   - [ ] Save as `data/processed/team_performance_2026.parquet`.\
\
2. **OR compute directly from `team_box`**\
   - [ ] Derive possessions, eFG%, etc. using formulas in `TARGET_DATA_SCHEMA.md`.\
   - [ ] Compute per\uc0\u8209 game and season\u8209 average metrics.\
\
### 4.4 Roster Metrics & `team_season_analytic`\
\
**Objective:** From `player_season_analytic_2026` and `team_performance_2026`, build `team_season_analytic_2026`.\
\
**Tasks:**\
\
1. **Experience and class shares**\
   - [ ] Compute minutes\uc0\u8209 weighted `exp_minutes_weighted`.\
   - [ ] Compute `minutes_share_freshman`, `minutes_share_sophomore`, `minutes_share_junior`, `minutes_share_senior_plus`.\
\
2. **Continuity and origin**\
   - [ ] Define `returning_flag` (players who were on the same team in previous season, if data available).\
   - [ ] Compute `continuity_minutes_share`.\
   - [ ] Compute `minutes_share_transfer`, `minutes_share_freshmen`, `minutes_share_intl`.\
\
3. **Positional and size profile**\
   - [ ] Compute `minutes_share_guard`, `minutes_share_wing`, `minutes_share_big`.\
   - [ ] Compute `avg_height_team`, `avg_height_guard`, `avg_height_wing`, `avg_height_big`.\
   - [ ] Compute league\uc0\u8209 average team height and `height_gap_vs_league`.\
\
4. **Bench depth**\
   - [ ] For each team, rank players by minutes; compute:\
     - `rotation_size_10mpg`\
     - `bench_minutes_share`\
     - `bench_minutes_share_10mpg`\
\
5. **Assemble final table**\
   - [ ] Join roster metrics with `team_performance_2026`.\
   - [ ] Join team metadata (conference, division) from `teams_sports_roster_data.csv`.\
   - [ ] Save as `data/processed/team_season_analytic_2026.parquet`/`.csv`.\
\
### 4.5 AP Top 25 Integration\
\
**Objective:** Tag Top 25 teams and enable Top 25\uc0\u8209 only EDA.\
\
**Tasks:**\
\
1. **Collect rankings**\
   - [ ] Choose a poll date (e.g., late January 2026).\
   - [ ] Scrape or manually enter AP Top 25 teams and ranks into `data/processed/ap_polls_2026.csv`.\
\
2. **Standardize names and join**\
   - [ ] Align poll team names with `team_season_analytic` `team_name` and/or `team_id`.\
   - [ ] Add `ap_rank` and `ap_poll_date` to `team_season_analytic`.\
\
3. **Create Top 25 subset**\
   - [ ] Filter to `ap_rank <= 25` for EDA file:\
     - `data/processed/team_season_analytic_2026_top25.csv`.\
\
---\
\
## 5. Tableau & Presentation Work\
\
### 5.1 Tableau Data Model\
\
**Sources to connect:**\
\
- `team_season_analytic_2026_top25.csv` (primary for cross\uc0\u8209 team views).\
- `player_season_analytic_2026.csv` (for roster strips and per\uc0\u8209 team deep dives).\
\
Use folders in Tableau\'92s data pane:\
\
- `Roster_Composition` \'96 experience, class shares, continuity.\
- `Roster_Size_Profile` \'96 height metrics, positional minutes.\
- `Roster_Acquisition` \'96 transfer, freshmen, intl shares.\
- `Performance_Team` \'96 offensive_eff, defensive_eff, margin, tempo.\
- `AP_Rankings` \'96 ap_rank, ap_poll_date.\
\
### 5.2 Core Views to Build\
\
**Views and tasks:**\
\
1. **Age vs Portal Scatter**\
   - [ ] Build scatter: exp_minutes_weighted vs minutes_share_transfer (Top 25).\
   - [ ] Color by conference, size by margin, label by ap_rank.\
\
2. **Size & Positional Profile vs Performance**\
   - [ ] Scatter: avg_height_big vs offensive_eff, color by minutes_share_big.\
   - [ ] Stacked bars of positional minutes for selected teams.\
\
3. **Bench Depth vs Success**\
   - [ ] Scatter: bench_minutes_share vs margin.\
   - [ ] Add reference lines and annotations for outlier teams.\
\
4. **Per\uc0\u8209 Team Roster View**\
   - [ ] Bar chart of minutes by player with class, transfer flag, and height displayed.\
   - [ ] Action filter from Top 25 scatter to this roster view.\
\
---\
\
## 6. Analysis & Storytelling Tasks\
\
**Analytic questions to answer in a notebook / narrative:**\
\
- [ ] Do Top 25 teams skew older (higher exp_minutes_weighted) than the D1 average?  \
- [ ] Are Top 25 teams more portal\uc0\u8209 heavy (minutes_share_transfer) than non\u8209 Top 25 teams?  \
- [ ] How does height by position correlate with offensive_eff and defensive_eff?  \
- [ ] Are teams with deeper rotations (higher bench_minutes_share or rotation_size_10mpg) more successful (higher margin)?  \
- [ ] Are there distinct \'93profiles\'94 among Top 25 teams (e.g., young/high\uc0\u8209 pace vs older/low\u8209 pace)?\
\
**Presentation tasks:**\
\
- [ ] Export key Tableau views for slides (PNG/SVG).  \
- [ ] Draft a 5\'9610 slide deck summarizing:\
  - Data & methodology.\
  - Roster construction patterns among Top 25.\
  - Notable outlier teams.\
  - Implications for recruiting/portal strategy.\

\
## 7. How to Work With an AI Assistant\
\
When using Claude/Claude Cowork:\
\
- For **coding tasks**, paste:\
  - Relevant schema snippets (from `TARGET_DATA_SCHEMA.md`).\
  - Small `head()` outputs of DataFrames when debugging.\
- For **analysis tasks**, ask specific questions:\
  - \'93Given this `team_season_analytic` CSV, suggest statistical tests or plots to compare Top 25 vs non\uc0\u8209 Top 25 on transfer minutes share.\'94\
- For **presentation tasks**, provide:\
  - Screenshots or field lists from Tableau views.\
  - A rough narrative; ask for help tightening wording, headlines, and annotations.\
\
Use this document as a living tracker: check off tasks, add new ones, and note decisions (e.g., thresholds for rotation, how transfer_flag is defined).\
